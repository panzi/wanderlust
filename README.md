**Work in progress!**

The idea is to write a database schema in the DDL of your DBMS, just like if you
would create the database from scratch and then use this tool to compare that to
what is actually in your DBMS and generate/run appropriate alter statements.

There are other tools that can do more or less the same, but they require their
own schema language. This is supposed to be in the DDL of your DBMS.

At first I will try to write this for PostgreSQL, later I'll maybe add SQLite
support. It might always be limited to my own needs, if I ever finish it at all.
